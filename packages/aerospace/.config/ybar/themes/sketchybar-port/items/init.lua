-- Workspace pills: pick the adapter for the installed window manager.
--
-- Both adapters build a FIXED pill set at load and bind it to the live
-- workspaces from async queries with retries, so neither needs the WM to be
-- answering yet. That matters because YBar and the WM are both launchd
-- LaunchAgents with no start order between them (measured here: YBar
-- 13:34:59, AeroSpace 13:35:00), and the AeroSpace adapter used to create
-- one pill per name from a synchronous query at load — an empty answer meant
-- zero pills for the session, which this file papered over with a 30 s
-- readiness poll that also held front_app back. The pills now reveal on the
-- first query that answers, from the adapters' own startup retries or their
-- routine poll, and nothing here waits.
--
-- Load order is bar order within a position: front_app follows the pills
-- immediately so it sits at their right.
