"""Parse `system_profiler SPAirPortDataType -json` (stdin) into TSV rows:

    current(0/1) \t ssid \t rssi \t secured(0/1)

Deduped by SSID keeping the strongest band; sorted current-first, then by
signal (unknown-signal networks last), then name.

NOTE ON REDACTION
-----------------
This file used to claim it was "the only macOS CLI source that still reports
real SSIDs without location permission". That is no longer true. Verified
against a live system: SPAirPortDataType -json now returns the literal string
"<redacted>" for the current network AND for every scanned network, exactly
like `ipconfig getsummary` and the plain-text profiler. The `airport` utility
that used to work has been removed from macOS.

Names are therefore unavailable from any command line without the Location
grant. The widget recovers the CURRENT network's name from YBar's own CoreWLAN
read (delivered in the wifi_change payload, which runs in-process where the
grant applies) and leaves the rest redacted, because nothing available can
resolve them.
